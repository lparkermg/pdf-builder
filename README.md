# PDF Builder

Builds and generates pdfs from markdown. Currently only builds CV related docs with a few different templates but will expand that to other types and more different templates.

## Pre-reqs

- Docker

## Running

In order to run locally, in the repo root run the following command `docker compose up --build -d` this will bring up all you need.

Then you just navigate to `http://localhost:5118/cv` in your browser to begin with what it can currently do.
